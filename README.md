# php-bounce-handler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malas/php-bounce-handler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malas/php-bounce-handler)

# This library is not yet released!

# Proper usage exmaples will be here after the release.

## Docker container is available

In order to develop this library/run the tests, the easiest way is to run docker container:

```
docker-compose up
```

For the first time you run this command, docker will build the container, so it will take longer to finish. When the container is built, the tests should run in a second.
